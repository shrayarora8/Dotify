# HW3 - Fragments, Activity Lifecycle, & Rotation
Name: Shray Arora

App description: Dotify is a simple replica of the the famous music app spotify and gave us a beginner introduction 
into the world of Android Programming. In this assignment, we understood the concept of recyclerviews and activities. Recyclerviews
are templates that a list will reuse instead of constantly getting viewByID as that is very expensive. Additionally, we made
our app a little more complex that includes a secondary activity thst utilizes a recyclerview to show us a list of songs.

Extra credit list: Did not ttempt any extra credit.
